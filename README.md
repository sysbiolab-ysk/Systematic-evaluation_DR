code for "Systematic evaluation of dimensionality reduction methods for capturing transcriptomic signatures responding to drug treatments"


Fig. 1: Schematic overview of the DR algorithm comparison framework. The Connectivity
Map (CMap) drug-induced transcriptomic data were categorized into four benchmark sets. Vari-
ous DR algorithms were evaluated using six performance metrics, and their sensitivity to different
embedding sizes was investigated.
